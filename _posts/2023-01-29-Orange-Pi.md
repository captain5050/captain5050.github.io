My current wifi router has an all or nothing approach to parental controls, I wanted to get a device to allow me to be more specific in blocking things and so here is what I've done so far.

### Getting the OrangePi

I got an [Orange Pi R1+ LTS](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-R1-Plus-LTS-With-Metal-Case.html
) from [Orange Pi's Ali Express store](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804508750716.html) as Raspberry Pis were low in stock and high in price.

I wanted two ethernet ports as the device will filter traffic and an SBC with a USB ethernet port hanging from didn’t sound great to me. I got the metal case as the CPUs/RAM get hot and the thermal mass helps dissipate that without a fan.

The price with case on [AliExpress was $35.99](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804508750716.html) ([price with no case is $27.99](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804506497194.html)), $7.49 shipping and $3.28 tax. Total $46.76.

I splurged a little on a [128GB Samsung “endurance” U3 speed (100/40 MB/s) sd card from Amazon for $15.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WB1857W?). This is way more than I need for this project and I may downgrade later and use this card in a different project. This brings my total cost to $62.75.

#### Things I liked before getting started

 * Dual ethernet. 
 * Powered off USB-C, should be able to survive on my UPS' USB power with my wifi router and modem during a power cut.
 * Reasonably powerful ARM quad-core - although spec is a few years old.
 * Very small and self contained.
 * Price.

#### Things I didn't like

 * 1GB of RAM feels small, especially compared to typical phone RAM sizes. That said with no GPU then lowering the price is good. Also, Pi Hole should be good with just 512MB of RAM.
 * Early Cortex A53s were full of bugs, so fingers crossed here.
 * OrangePi is understandably Chinese focused and I wanted to run a more stock distro - would have preferred a cheap Raspberry Pi with this kind of configuration.
 * One ethernet port is internally over USB.
 * The name - what's the significance of LTS?

### Getting started

Once you have the OrangePi the next thing you'll need to do is set it up.

 * Download and image sdcard
   * On [orangepi.org](http://www.orangepi.org/) there is a downloads section where you [select the R1+ LTS](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-Pi-R1-Plus-LTS.html).
   * Follow the [ubuntu link that opens Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HpBG4UeRE1fXVlajXG3O7N7m78KSRY3X) and download the newer focal release (ubuntu 20.04).
   * Follow a [guide on SD card image writing](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sd-cards-and-writing-images/all).
 * Mount the sdcard and copy the file `/boot/orangepi_first_run.txt.template` to `/boot/orangepi_first_run.txt`.
 * Edit `/boot/orangepi_first_run.txt`.
   * It is a bit nerve-racking booting the Orange Pi as there is no screen or keyboard, you are just hoping it will start and you can connect to it some how. I'd suggest connecting the device to your network as a regular dynamic IP address client using the LAN port of your router and the LAN port on the device. My router allows me to see the assigned IP address as well as make it the same every time. The `/boot/orangepi_first_run.txt` does allow a static IP assignment and you can connect the device to ethernet without a cross-over cable, but I didn't get very far with this and it was easier to just go the dynamic IP address route until I could log into the device and set it up.
 * Put the sdcard in the Orange Pi R1+ LTS, make sure the LAN is connected to the router and power on.
 * If everything went according to plan it takes just seconds to boot and you can ssh to the device `ssh root@192.168.x.y`. The password is initially set to `orangepi`.

### Updating to the latest ubuntu

I wanted to update the ubuntu on the image and hopefully get it closer to stock.
 * Switching from to a US repository.
   * The image is set up to download ubuntu packages from http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu-ports/ which isn't particularly quick in the US.
   * Modify `/etc/apt/sources.list` and change `http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu-ports/` to `http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports`. I did this by first `apt install`-ing emacs. Commenting out the original lines and making modified versions with search and replace. The 4 lines looked like:
```
deb http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ focal main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ focal-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ focal-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ focal-backports main restricted universe multiverse
```
 * Next was doing the upgrade (no sudo as I was logged in as root, there's a `-d` option for `do-release-upgrade` if you want a development release):
```bash
$ apt update
$ apt upgrade
$ apt install update-manager-core
$ do-release-upgrade
```

### Getting rid of a CPU hog

Running `top` showed a lot of time going to `set_r1plus_lan_mac.sh`. I located that this was started in `/etc/rc.local` and so I commented out the line to run it as well as killing the process. The command appears to be trying to change the mac address of the device eth0 to be the same as lan0. Perhaps it was something left over from development. The loop appending 0s to make sure the MAC address is sufficiently long never terminates as `lan0` should probably be `eth0` (the inbuilt WAN device) or `enxc...` (the USB/LAN interface).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

MAC_BEF=$(cat /sys/class/net/lan0/address |cut -b -6)
MAC=$(cat /sys/class/net/lan0/address |cut -b 7-)
MAC=${MAC//:/""}
MAC=$((16#$MAC))
MAC=$(($MAC-1))
MAC=`printf %x $MAC`
NUM=`expr 8 - ${#MAC}`

while [ $NUM -ne 0 ]
do
        MAC=0$MAC
        let "NUM--"
done

echo ${MAC} >> /usr/local/test.log
echo ${MAC_BEF} >> /usr/local/test.log
MAC=${MAC_BEF}${MAC:0:2}:${MAC:2:2}:${MAC:4:2}:${MAC:6}

ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig eth0 hw ether $MAC
ifconfig eth0 up
```

Fixing this lowered the load to around 0, rather than 1, and the temperature went from 46'C to 39'C on the device.

### Setup networking

I wanted to connect my laptop to the LAN port and my modem to the WAN port, set up port forwarding and then switch from my laptop being on the LAN port to using the wifi router on the LAN port.

The first thing is to think a bit about IP addresses. My wifi router uses a subnet of `192.168.86.0/24` but if you use static IPs outside of the router in that subnet, it will jump to the next subnet of `192.168.87.0/24`. So I set up the R1+ to have a subnet of `192.168.1.0/24` with the R1+ having an IP address of `192.168.1.1/24`. I configured this using `nmtui` which is in the `network-manager` package. The IP address configuration under IPv4 was set to manual and no gateway was given. `nmtui` shows two devices when configuring and it is worth checking you're setting up the LAN by looking at the MAC address. You can get this information using `ip a`.

On my laptop I added a USB network adapter and connected it to the R1+ on the LAN socket. I configured that device to have an IP address of `192.168.1.2` on the subnet of `192.168.1.0/24` with no gateway. With this I could ssh into the R1+ with `ssh root@192.168.1.1`.

On the R1+ the WAN port was setup with an automatic (dynamic) configuration. I connected the WAN port directly to the modem and after a restart the WAN port was correctly configured by DHCP from the modem and I still had my static IP access to the LAN port.
