### Getting the orangepi

I got an [orange pi r1 LTS](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-R1-Plus-LTS-With-Metal-Case.html
) as raspberry pis were low in stock and high in price. I wanted two ethernet ports as the device will filter traffic and an SBC with a USB ethernet port hanging from didn’t sound great to me. I got the metal case as the CPUs/RAM get hot and the thermal mass helps dissipate that without a fan.
Things I didn’t like, just 1GB of RAM (although pi hole should be good with just 512MB), cortex A53s are full of bugs and this thing has 4 of them, orangepi is understandably Chinese focused and I wanted to run a more stock distro. One ethernet port is over USB and I 
The price with case on Aliexpress was $35.99, $7.49 shipping and $3.28 tax. Total $46.76.
On top of this I splurged a little on a 128GB Samsung “endurance” U3 speed (100/40 MB/s) sd card from Amazon for $15.99, which is way more than I need for this project and I may downgrade later and use this card in a different project.

### Getting started
Download and image sdcard
Mount sdcard copy then modify /boot/orangepi_first_run.txt.template
SDcard in orange pi, plug LAN into router, power on.. Should detect DHCP and can connect
Ssh root@192.168.x.y password orangepi

### Updating ubuntu
Modify /etc/apt/sources.list
Change to http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports from http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu-ports/
$ sudo apt install update-manager-core
$ do-release-upgrade

### Setup networking

#### Setup a dhcp server on the LAN port
